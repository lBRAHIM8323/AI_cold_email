Ensure clear subject line, value-focused messaging, no excessive self-promotion, and avoid generic language.

Output only the email draft and subject line, with placeholders for name, company, and contact links.

Instructions:

Rigorously check every statement against my resume content. If uncertain about an achievement, qualify it as an interest or motivation, not a claim.

If the resume lacks a specific skill, do NOT invent or imply it.

Never use attachments in the initial email—only offer to share documents if requested.

Follow the structure and tips provided. Use plain, professional English. Do not copy full resume contents.
